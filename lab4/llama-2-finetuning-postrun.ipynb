Yet not nearly enough to deserve Sachin's adoration.\\n\\nSachin is great in my opinion mostly because of his age when he first entered the cricket scene; to perform what he did at the age of 16 is incredible. Consider yourself at 16...and then consider Imran, Waqar, and Wasim blasting into you at 16 in front of a partisan crowd, with all of India watching. Consider yourself as a 16-year-old fighting the arch-enemy Pakistan. Imagine yourself at the age of 16 being smashed on the body with a leather ball. Consider yourself at 16 years old, attempting to focus on the ball in front of a roaring crowd.\\n\\nThat is what he did....\\n\\n\\nAnd a legend was born!\\n\\nHis achievements from 16 - 22 are the stuff of legend; and that is his primary claim to greatness.\\n\\n\\nYes, there are other factors: his simplicity, his focus, his concentration, his determination, his longevity etc... but the primary one is the aspect listed above.\\n\\n\\nBut even that does not explain his sustained claim to greatness over the years,\\n\\nTo this, we must add that he is a fighter who enjoys a good challenge. The manner he dealt with the top fast bowlers of the day, like as Allan Donald. And his famed war with Shane Warne... these battles, and more, when he faced the opposition, are unique to him; almost.\\n\\n\\nAnd then there's the fact that he's believed to have the purest game with the widest range of shots... To watch him bat is to witness beauty in action, poetry in motion. There is no better sight than Sachin in full flow...\\n\\nAnd the icing on the cake?\\n\\nHe has succeeded in all forms of the game. Try and find me 2 other players who have done that.\"}"

The history of wine-making stretches over millennia. The science of wine and winemaking is known as oenology. A winemaker may also be called a vintner. The growing of grapes is viticulture and there are many varieties of grapes.\\n\\nWinemaking can be divided into two general categories: still wine production (without carbonation) and sparkling wine production (with carbonation – natural or injected). Red wine, white wine, and rosé are the other main categories. Although most wine is made from grapes, it may also be made from other plants. (See fruit wine.) Other similar light alcoholic drinks (as opposed to beer or spirits) include mead, made by fermenting honey and water, cider (\"apple cider\"), made by fermenting the juice of apples, and perry (\"pear cider\"), made by fermenting the juice of pears, and kumis, made of fermented mare's milk.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Response:\\n</td>\n",

He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the \"most wholesome batsman of his time\". His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia. He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot. In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that \"it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does\".

After being kidnapped to Anatolia he was brought to Egypt as a slave by Ibrahim Pasha in 1830 and was converted to Islam. Immediately following his arrival, he studied at al-Maktab al-Amiri and obtained his advanced degree in 1834. He was fluent in Greek and was elevated to the rank of First Lieutenant by Egypt's viceroy Muhammad Ali Pasha. In 1836, he became head of the Accounting and Revenue Agencies. He was promoted to the rank of bikbashi (Lieutenant Colonel) in 1840, then kaymakam (Colonel) in 1844, and finally amiralay (Brigadier General) in 1846.[citation needed]\\n\\nHe held the positions of Minister of Finance (1858–1860), then Minister of War (1860–1861).[citation needed] He became Inspector for the Maritime Provinces in 1862, and later Assistant (Arabic: باشمعاون) to viceroy Isma'il Pasha (1863–1865). He was granted the title of beylerbey and then appointed President of the Privy council in 1868. He was appointed President of the Chamber of Deputies (1866–1867), then Minister of Interior in 1867, then Minister of Agriculture and Trade in 1875.[citation needed] He again held the Finance portfolio in Muhammad Sharif Pasha's first government (1879). After the fall of Mahmoud Sami el-Baroudi's government, Isma'il Ragheb became Prime Minister of Egypt in 1882.[citation needed] Although his government was short-lived (it lasted from 17 June to 21 August only), it was the only one to present concrete programs. His achievements include the modernisation of the budget through the inventory of revenues and expenses, the Law on Salaries, and the La'eha Sa'ideyya as well as several agricultural laws.[citation needed]\\n\\nIsma'il Ragheb died in 1884.[citation needed]\\n\\n\\n\\n### Response:\\n</td>\n",
